<p><strong>DON'T&nbsp;SKIP&nbsp;THIS!</strong></p><p>---</p><p>With React 16.8, a new feature called "<strong>React Hooks</strong>"&nbsp;was introduced. This course already covers this feature and this module, up to this point, is 100% up-to-date with that feature (e.g. you learned about <code>useEffect()</code>).</p><p>The upcoming lectures marked as <strong>"[LEGACY]"</strong> are only there to allow existing students who started this module before the update (on February 6th 2019) to continue smoothly.</p><p>You can skip all remaining lectures in this module (i.e. the lectures with <strong>"[LEGACY]"</strong>) if you watched all the other lectures prior to this one.</p>
